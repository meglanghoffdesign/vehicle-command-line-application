## Description
A command-line tool that allows users to interact with a selection of vehicles and run a series of actions. Users can create new vehicles, which are saved to a library for future use. Once a vehicle is created, users can select it from the library and perform various actions such as starting, accelerating, decelerating, turning, towing (for trucks), and performing a wheelie (for motorbikes). This tool ensures that the vehicle actions are executed based on the type of vehicle selected and provides a dynamic user interface to interact with the available vehicles.

## Usage
When you run the program, it will present you with a list of available vehicles. You can create new vehicles by entering their details, and they will be saved to your library for future selection. Once a vehicle is selected, you will be prompted with a list of actions you can perform. The actions vary depending on the type of vehicle selected (e.g., towing for trucks, wheelie for motorbikes).
